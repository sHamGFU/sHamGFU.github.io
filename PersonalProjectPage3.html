    <h3>Timing</h3>
    <p>One of the basics to know about animation is how the timing works. How do you get animation to move at the
        pace that it does? Well, it depends on how many frames per second you use, and how many of those frames has
        a new drawing.</p>

    <p>Frames per second, or fps, can be as many or few frames as you wish, though the standard that is usually used
        to communicate fluid movement is 24 fps. Though you may hav 24 frames in each second of animation, that doesn't
        mean all of those frames have to all be different from each other. Often in the field of animation, animators
        will animate on 1s or 2s. Animating on 1s does mean having 24 different drawings for the 24 fps, but animating
        on 2s means that there are 12 different drawings for the 24 fps, each lasting for 2 frames.</p>

    <h3>The 12 Principles of Animation</h3>
    <p>12 Principles for animation were compiled by Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas as elements necessary to make
        animation that is well-rounded and appealing.</p>

    <p>The 12 Principles Are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Squash and Stretch<li>
        <li>Timing and Motion</li>
        <li>Anticipation</li>
        <li>Staging</li>
        <li>Follow-Through and Overlapping Action</li>
        <li>Straight Ahead and Pose-to-Pose Action</li>
        <li>Slow In and Out</li>
        <li>Arcs</li>
        <li>Exaggeration</li>
        <li>Secondary Action</li>
        <li>Solid Drawing</li>
        <li>Appeal</li>
    </ol>
