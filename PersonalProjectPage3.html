    <h3>Timing</h3>
    <p>One of the basics to know about animation is how the timing works. How do you get animation to move at the
        pace that it does? Well, it depends on how many frames per second you use, and how many of those frames has
        a new drawing.</p>

    <p>Frames per second, or fps, can be as many or few frames as you wish, though the standard that is usually used
        to communicate fluid movement is 24 fps.</p>
