    <h1>What is Animation?</h1>

<div>
    <h3>Animation is what happens when a sequence of images are shown one after another to produce the illusion of
    movement.</h3>

    <p>Now when you think of animation and how far back it goes in history, you'd probably think it goes only to the
        old cartoons back in th 20th century, but would you believe it if the history of animation goes all the way back
        to prehistoric times?</p>

    <p>The first examples of animation come from cave paintings, where animals were depicted with multiple sets of
        legs. This, combined with the flickering light of a campfire would make the paintings the illusion of
        movement.</p>

    <p>Another example of animation in earlier history is the Phenakistiscope, invented in 1833. It is a disk that is
        divided into equal portions (each portion equaling one frame) and would display something that would move
        when the disk was spun.</p>

    <p>The first animation most similar to what we are all familiar with today was the silent film Fantasmagorie,
        released in 1908. The film was made traditionally, or drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each of
        those frames onto negative film.</p>

    <p>From there on, animation continued to grow into the cartoons we all know and love and even further into films,
        including CGI (Computer Generated Images) movies!</p>
