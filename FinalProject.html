                The snow leopard is an amazing big cat located in the Eastern Himalayas. It is nicknamed the ghost
                of the mountain for its tendency to be shy and reclusive.
            </h3>

            <p class="p1">
                This cat is built for the cold mountainous climates it calls home, with strong legs for jumping,
                a long tail for balance, and thick paw pads to help walks on snow.
                Unfortunately, the snow leopard is facing hardships within its own habitats due to habitat loss,
                human contact, poaching, and retaliation killing. This has led to their populations to decrease
                significantly over the past decades.
            </p>

            <p class="stats">
                <u>Current Status:</u> Vulnerable <br>

                <u>Current Population:</u> est. 4,000 - 6,500
            </p>

            <p class="p2">
                Conservation efforts have been paying off in the last year though as the snow leopard population
                in Mongolia is currently stable at a population of 953, giving hope that this incredible cat can
                live plentifully once again.
