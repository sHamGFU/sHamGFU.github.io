    <h1>2D vs. 3D</h1>
</div>

<div>
    <p>As mentioned in the first page, there are many ways in which animation can be done - here we will talk about 2D
        and 3D. There are surprisingly some similarities among the differences between the two and how they can be
        done.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>To start with some differences, 2D works in that everything that is seen of a character, for example, is all
        that exists. If the character is walking and their arm passes behind them, and we do not see it, then the
        character's arm disappears behind the character until it comes into view again. But with 3D, when that same
        action would happen, the arm does not disappear despite the audience not being able to see it. This is because,
        as stated with their names, the 3D character is set up in a virtual (or physical with stop-motion) open space
        with 3D objects in it while 2D happens in a flat surface.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Something that both can have in similarity, though, is rigging! Rigging is when something in need of animating
        is given a frame that connects to the parts of the joints of an object called bones (called so due to it
        looking like an internal skeletal system). This is standard in 3D animation to move objects, but is an optional
        way to do 2D animation.</p>

    <p>What's even more fun is that in recent years, 2D and 3D animation have been mixed together to bring out aspects
        from both styles of animation. The film, Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse is an example of mixing 2D and 3D
        animation!</p>
